# ðŸš€ Results & Demonstration
## ðŸ”„ Real-Time Drowsiness Detection
The system continuously captures live video feed using an in-cabin camera and processes each frame using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Eye states (open or closed) are classified in real time. A drowsiness score is incremented when eyes are closed for prolonged periods, simulating actual fatigue behavior. Once a threshold is reached, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver.

Eye activity is monitored using Haar cascades and fed into a 10-layer CNN.

The CNN runs inference on every frame, classifying the eye state as open or closed.

If both eyes are classified as closed consistently, a cumulative score increases.

Upon exceeding the threshold, an audio alert is played via the onboard system.
