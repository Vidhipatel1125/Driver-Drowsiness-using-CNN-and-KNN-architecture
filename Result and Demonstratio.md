# ðŸš€ Results & Demonstration
## ðŸ”„ Real-Time Drowsiness Detection
The system continuously captures live video feed using an in-cabin camera and processes each frame using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Eye states (open or closed) are classified in real time. A drowsiness score is incremented when eyes are closed for prolonged periods, simulating actual fatigue behavior. Once a threshold is reached, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver.

Eye activity is monitored using Haar cascades and fed into a 10-layer CNN.

The CNN runs inference on every frame, classifying the eye state as open or closed.

If both eyes are classified as closed consistently, a cumulative score increases.

Upon exceeding the threshold, an audio alert is played via the onboard system.

## ðŸ”” Real-Time Scoring & Alert Mechanism
The system uses a dynamic drowsiness scoring algorithm to evaluate driver fatigue in real time. It continuously monitors the state of both eyes using a live video feed. Here's how it works:

Each video frame is processed through a trained CNN model to detect whether the driver's eyes are open or closed.

If both eyes are detected as closed in a frame, a counter-based drowsiness score is incremented.

If eyes are open, the score is decremented or stabilized, ensuring false positives (e.g., blinking) don't trigger alerts.

## ðŸš¨ Alarm Trigger Logic
Once the drowsiness score crosses a defined threshold, the system assumes the driver is likely to be drowsy.

At that point, an auditory alarm (alarm.wav) is triggered to alert the driver.

This score-and-threshold mechanism avoids reacting to brief eye closures or blinks, focusing only on sustained signs of fatigue.
