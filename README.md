# Driver-Drowsiness-using-CNN-and-KNN-architecture
This project presents a real-time drowsiness detection and alert system designed to improve road safety by identifying fatigue in drivers using computer vision and machine learning techniques. By integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the system analyzes live video feeds from in-vehicle cameras to detect signs of drowsiness and triggers alerts to mitigate risks.

ðŸš— Problem Statement
Drowsy driving is a leading cause of traffic accidents and fatalities. Traditional systems relying on physical sensors or manual observation are often ineffective. This project addresses the challenge by developing a camera-based AI system that autonomously detects driver fatigue through facial analysis.

ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview
CNN Model trained to detect closed and open eyes from facial imagery.

KNN Classifier used to refine predictions by analyzing features extracted using ResNet50.

Real-Time Detection Pipeline built with OpenCV to continuously monitor eye state.

Audible Alert System that triggers when signs of drowsiness persist.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow, Keras
OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn
CNN (Custom 10-layer) and ResNet50 for feature extraction
KNN for binary classification (Drowsy vs Alert)
Haar Cascades for face and eye detection
Pygame for audio alerts
